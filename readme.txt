"Lite YouTube Embeds" look like normal YouTube embeds but don't use Flash, thus reducing download size & page rendering time.

== Description ==

WP YouTube Lyte inserts "Lite YouTube Embeds" in your blog. These look and feel like normal embedded YouTube, but only call the actual "fat" Flash or HTML5-player when clicked on, thereby [reducing download size & rendering time substantially](http://blog.futtta.be/2010/08/30/the-state-of-wp-youtube-lyte/) when embedding YouTube occasionally and improving page performance dramatically when you've got multiple YouTube video's on one and the same page.

Just add a YouTube-link for a video or [an entire playlist](http://blog.futtta.be/2011/10/11/wp-youtube-lyte-support-for-playlists-almost-included/) with "httpv" (or "httpa" to [embed YouTube's audio](http://blog.futtta.be/2011/04/19/audio-only-youtube-embedding-with-wp-youtube-lyte-0-7/) only) instead of "http" or add a Lyte widget to your sidebar and WP YouTube Lyte replaces that link with the correct performance-optimized code. When a visitor clicks the play-button, WP YouTube Lyte seamlessly initiates [YouTube's new embedded player](http://apiblog.youtube.com/2010/07/new-way-to-embed-youtube-videos.html). Some examples:

* httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SQkWbRublY (normal video embed)
* httpv://youtu.be/_SQkWbRublY (video embed with youtube-shortlink)
* httpa://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SQkWbRublY (audio only embed)
* httpv://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA486E741B25F8E00 (playlist embed)
* httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SQkWbRublY#stepSize=-1 (video player, one size smaller than what's configured as default)

WP YouTube Lyte has been written with optimal performance as primary goal, but has been tested for maximum browser-compatibility (iPad included) while keeping an eye on accessibility. The plugin is fully multi-language, with support for Catalan, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Spanish and Slovene.

Feedback is welcome; see [info in the faq](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/faq/) for bug reports/ feature requests and feel free to [rate and/or report on compatibility on wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/).

== Installation ==

Just install form your Wordpress "Plugins|Add New" screen and all will be well. Manual installation is very straightforward as well:

1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place a link to a YouTube clip like this; httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SQkWbRublY

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does "html5 video support" mean? =
When playing, HTML5 video will not be visible for everyone (see requirements). Indeed some visitors will see the fallback Flash video instead.

= What are the requirements to see embedded YouTube HTML5 video? =
* It only works in browsers that support the h264 (Safari, Chrome, IE9) or WebM (currently Chrome, Opera and Firefox) video codecs
* Your visitor has to be enrolled in the [YouTube html5 beta](http://www.youtube.com/html5)

= Does WP YouTube Lyte protect my visitor's privacy? =
As opposed to some of the [most important](http://blog.futtta.be/2010/12/15/wordpress-com-stats-trojan-horse-for-quantcast-tracking/) [plugins](http://blog.futtta.be/2010/01/22/add-to-any-removed-from-here/) there is no 3rd party tracking code in WP YouTube Lyte, but YouTube off course does see visitor requests coming in (see also the youtube-nocookie.com remark in Bugs/Issues below).

= Can I use WP YouTube Lyte for a custom field? =
As tested and confirmed by [rumultik.ru's Dimitri](http://rumultik.ru) (thanks for that man!), this indeed does work. Just pass the httpv url of such a field to lyte_parse like this: 
`if(function_exists('lyte_parse')) { echo lyte_parse($video); }`
and you're good to go!

= Any bugs/ issues should I know about? =
* The playlist-player currently does not work on iPad or iPhone, this is a known limitation of Youtube's playlist player and [is on the todo-list to get fixed](http://groups.google.com/group/youtube-api-gdata/browse_frm/thread/adbec924f43688e5#)
* The new YouTube embed-code doesn't look great when using WP YouTube Lyte widgets in your sidebar. This is because YouTube's embedded player doesn't scale well for small sizes, this is something that YouTube should (and hopefully will) fix at a later stage.
* Having the same YouTube-video on one page can cause WP YouTube Lyte to malfunction (as the YouTube id is used as the div's id in the DOM, and DOM id's are supposed to be unique)
* As youtube-nocookie.com does not serve the HTML5-player, WP YouTube Lyte uses the youtube.com domain (which provides less privacy), but as soon as youtube-nocookie.com serves HTML5-video, this will become the default domain for WP YouTube Lyte again.

= I found a bug/ I would like a feature to be added! =
* Just tell me, I like the feedback! Use the [Contact-page on my blog](http://blog.futtta.be/contact/), [leave a comment in a post about wp-youtube-lyte](http://blog.futtta.be/tag/wp-youtube-lyte/) or [create a new topic on the wordpress.org forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-youtube-lyte?forum_id=10#postform).

= How you can help =
* Tell me about bugs you think you've found and if you can't find any, [confirm it works with your version of WP on wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/)
* Ask me for a feature you would like to see added
* [Rate my plugin on wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/), even if you think it stinks ;-)
